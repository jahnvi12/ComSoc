Dr. Neeldhara Misra as a part of Summer Research and Internship Programme at IIT Gandhinagar. 
Computational social choice is an interdisciplinary field that is concerned with the application of techniques developed in 
computer science, such as complexity analysis or algorithm design, to the study of social choice mechanisms, such as voting procedures 
or fair allocation of resources among stakeholders.
